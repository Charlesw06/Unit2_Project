LinearEquation class -
    Instance Variables:
        private int x1 - This variable represents the x-value of point 1
        private int x2 - This variable represents the x-value of point 2
        private int y1 - This variable represents the y-value of point 1
        private int y2 - This variable represents the y-value of point 2

    Constructor:
        public LinearEquation (int x1, int x2, int y1, int y2)

    Methods:
        public double distance()
            This method will return the distance between point 1 and point 2 as a double rounded to the nearest hundredth

        public double slope()
            This method will return the slope of the line as a double rounded to the nearest hundredth

        public double yIntercept()
            This method will return the y-intercept of the line as a double rounded to the nearest hundredth

        public String equationOfLine()
            This method will return the equation of the line connecting point 1 and point 2

        public String toString()
            Prints out the information of the line including:
             - The slope of the line
             - The y-intercept of the line
             - The equation of the line
             - The distance between point 1 and point 2

        public String newPoint(double userX)
            This method will return the corresponding coordinates for the x-value used as a parameter

EquationRunner.java -

Step 1: Imports scanner utility
Step 2: Welcomes user
Step 3: Prompts the user to enter point 1
Step 4: Sets int userX1 and userY1 to the corresponding coordinates from the input
Step 5: Prompts the user to enter point 2
Step 6: Sets int userX2 and userY2 to the corresponding coordinates from the input
Step 7: Creates new LinearEquation object using userX1, userY1, userX2, and userY2
Step 8: Prints out information of the line
Step 9: Prompts user for a x value on the line that is a double
Step 10: Sets userX to user's input
Step 11: Prints out corresponding coordinates for user's x-value
